# Pomodoro Timer Overview

This application is intended to be used as a productivity tool by the user where they work for 25 minutes and then have a 5 minute break.

Issues:

Clicking on the start then clicking on it again means that the user can speed up the timer and make the timer go quicker. This is not helpful if the user were to exploit such a measure to be counterproductive.
